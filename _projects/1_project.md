It has been proposed that there may be underlying regularities in how languages encode perceptual experiences in words, pointing to the possibility that our cognitive architecture plays a role in constraining the variability in this domain of language. This project aims to test this idea by investigating how basic perceptual experiences (e.g. seeing, hearing, smelling) are encoded by verbs across languages, how they evolve over time, and how they are learned. The project is a collaboration with Asifa Majid (Oxford), and received funding from European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement 836921 [LEXPEX])

One line of research has focused on variability and regularity across languages in how sensory meanings map onto perception verbs. One study {% cite norcliffe_verbs_2024 %}, drawing on a global sample of perception verb lexicons, provided the first quantitative test of the influential claim that a hierarchy of senses universally constrains the semantic organisation of perception verb lexicons across languages. This work  demonstrated that although perception verb lexicons show a strong, apparently universal visual bias, they do not exhibit patterning consistent with the proposed universal hierarchy of senses. Beyond the hierarchy, the study uncovered new kinds of regularities in the polysemy patterns of perception verbs across languages, with the evidence pointing to the conclusion that domain-general constraints (conceptual similarity and communicative pressures) jointly interact to give rise to the cross-linguistic patterns.
