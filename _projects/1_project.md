It has been proposed that there may be underlying regularities in how languages encode perceptual experiences in words, pointing to the possibility that our cognitive architecture plays a role in constraining the variability in this domain of language. This project aims to test this idea by investigating how basic perceptual experiences (e.g. seeing, hearing, smelling) are encoded by verbs across languages, how they evolve over time, and how they are learned. The project is a collaboration with Asifa Majid (Oxford), and received funding from European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement 836921 [LEXPEX])

One line of research has focused on variability and regularity across languages in how sensory meanings map onto perception verbs. One study {% cite norcliffe_verbs_2024 %}, drawing on a global sample of perception verb lexicons, provided the first quantitative test of the influential claim that a hierarchy of senses universally constrains the semantic organisation of perception verb lexicons across languages. This work  demonstrated that although perception verb lexicons show a strong, apparently universal visual bias, they do not exhibit patterning consistent with the proposed universal hierarchy of senses. Beyond the hierarchy, the study uncovered new kinds of regularities in the polysemy patterns of perception verbs across languages, with the evidence pointing to the conclusion that domain-general constraints (conceptual similarity and communicative pressures) jointly interact to give rise to the cross-linguistic patterns. 

In a related study {% cite norcliffe_word_2024 %}, we extended the focus to patterns of word formation in perception verb lexicons. Perception verbs sometimes extend their meaning to a different sensory meaning through processes of word formation. For example, the verb ‘hear’ might combine with a noun ‘odour’, to derive a verb meaning ‘to smell’.  Our study found that across languages, semantic extensions of this type tend to proceed hierarchically from higher to lower sense modalities. We suggest that human biology and neurophysiology do not need to be directly invoked to explain this hierarchical patterning, however. Previous research has demonstrated that the directionality of semantic extensions in word formation is predicted by word frequency: words that are the sources of extensions tend to be more frequent than the derivations. Lexical frequency therefore is likely the direct cause of our directionality finding, as it has been shown that verbs of vision and audition tend to be more frequent in speech than those of the lower senses. This does not rule out the possibility that the crosslinguistic frequency patterns themselves are shaped by the relative dominance of the senses in human perception, though research suggests that these lexical frequency patterns are more likely the outcome of convergent factors.
