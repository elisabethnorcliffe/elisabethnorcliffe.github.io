It has been proposed that there may be underlying regularities in how languages encode perceptual experiences in words, pointing to the possibility that our cognitive architecture plays a role in constraining the variability in this domain of language. This project aims to test this idea by investigating how basic perceptual experiences (e.g. seeing, hearing, smelling) are encoded by verbs across languages, how they evolve over time, and how they are learned. 

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
