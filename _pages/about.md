I am a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie fellow in the Department of Experimental Psychology at Oxford. Previously I worked as a staff scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen. I hold a Masters in Linguistics from the University of Canterbury (New Zealand) and a PhD in Linguistics from Stanford University.  

My research lies at the intersection of linguistic typology and psycholinguistics. One strand of my work concentrates on charting cross-linguistic variation and identifying the factors (communicative, cultural, cognitive) that shape and constrain it.  A second, related strand concerns the consequences of typological variation for language processing. I study these topics mainly at the level of morphosyntax and lexical semantics. A core thread in my research is an emphasis on less-studied languages, both for their contribution to our understanding of linguistic diversity and its limits, and as a means of widening the empirical base of psycholinguistic research. My work draws particularly on primary data from languages of Meso and South America, as well as on large-scale global typological datasets, and involves a range of behavioural experimental, quantitative and qualitative methods.

I am also involved in the linguistic documentation and comparative-historical analysis of languages of Andean South America, with a particular focus on Guambiano (Nam Trik) and related Barbacoan languages of Ecuador and Colombia.
